# AngularJS Phone Catalog Tutorial Application


## Overview

This is a clone of https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat

This copy takes step 3 of the angular-phonecat tutorial, removes the E2E testing,
removes bower, and configures the application with npm/Webpack only.
This is a more "2018" way to use AngularJS 1.x

This application takes the developer through the process of building a web-application using
AngularJS. The application is loosely based on the **Google Phone Gallery**, which no longer exists.
Here is a historical reference: [Google Phone Gallery on WayBack][google-phone-gallery]
(Wow! AngularJS 1.x is old!)

The full tutorial can be found at https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial.


## Prerequisites

### Git

- A good place to learn about setting up git is [here][git-setup].
- You can find documentation and download git [here][git-home].

### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node].
- Install the tool dependencies: `npm install`


## Workings of the Application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed][angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application. Instead we fake the
  application server by fetching static JSON files.
- Read the _Development_ section at the end to familiarize yourself with running and developing
  an Angular application.


### step-0 _Bootstrapping_

- Add the 'angular.js' script.
- Add the `ngApp` directive to bootstrap the application.
- Add a simple template with an expression.

### step-1 _Static Template_

- Add a stylesheet file ('app/app.css').
- Add a static list with two phones.

### step-2 _Angular Templates_

- Convert the static phone list to dynamic by:
  - Creating a `PhoneListController` controller.
  - Extracting the data from HTML into the controller as an in-memory dataset.
  - Converting the static document into a template with the use of the `ngRepeat` directive.
- Add a simple unit test for the `PhoneListController` controller to show how to write tests and
  run them using Karma.

### step-3 _Components_

- Introduce components.
- Combine the controller and the template into a reusable, isolated `phoneList` component.
- Refactor the application and tests to use the `phoneList` component.

### step-4

- Please see https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat for additional steps.


### Running the Application during Development

- Run `npm start`.
- Navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the application
  running.

### Unit Testing

We recommend using [Jasmine][jasmine] and [Karma][karma] for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

- Start Karma with `npm test`.
- A browser will start and connect to the Karma server. Chrome and Firefox are the default browsers,
  others can be captured by loading the same URL or by changing the `karma.conf.js` file.
- Karma will sit and watch your application and test JavaScript files. To run or re-run tests just
  change any of your these files.

## Application Directory Layout

```
app/                     --> all the source code of the app (along with unit tests)
  core/                  --> all the source code of the core module (stuff used throughout the app)
    checkmark/...        --> files for the `checkmark` filter, including JS source code, specs
    phone/...            --> files for the `core.phone` submodule, including JS source code, specs
    core.module.js       --> the core module
  img/...                --> image files
  phone-detail/...       --> files for the `phoneDetail` module, including JS source code, HTML templates, specs
  phone-list/...         --> files for the `phoneList` module, including JS source code, HTML templates, specs
  phones/...             --> static JSON files with phone data (used to fake a backend API)
  app.animations.css     --> hooks for running CSS animations with `ngAnimate`
  app.animations.js      --> hooks for running JS animations with `ngAnimate`
  app.config.js          --> app-wide configuration of Angular services
  app.css                --> default stylesheet
  app.module.js          --> the main app module
  index.html             --> app layout file (the main HTML template file of the app)

node_modules/...         --> development tools (fetched using `npm`)

scripts/                 --> handy scripts
  private/...            --> private scripts used by the Angular Team to maintain this repo
  update-repo.sh         --> script for pulling down the latest version of this repo (!!! DELETES ALL CHANGES YOU HAVE MADE !!!)

karma.conf.js            --> config file for running unit tests with Karma
package.json             --> Node.js specific metadata, including development tools dependencies
```
